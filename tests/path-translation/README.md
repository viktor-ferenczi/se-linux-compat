# Path translation tests

Verifies that `PathTranslation.Init()` maps the install the game is running
from. The install root is `MyFileSystem.RootPath`, which the launcher sets to
the folder above the executable directory before any plugin runs, so the plugin
knows nothing about Steam or where the game was installed.

The suite is standalone. It compiles
`Shared/Patches/PathHandling/PathTranslation.cs` verbatim against a fabricated
`$HOME` and root path, so it needs neither the game nor Steam, and it touches
nothing on disk. `IngressTraceStub.cs` replaces the real `IngressTrace`, which
reaches into `PathCache`, `PathHelpers` and `MyLog` and cannot compile outside
the game. `MyFileSystemStub.cs` provides the one `RootPath` field
`PathTranslation` reads.

It is not part of `LinuxCompat.sln`: it targets plain `net10.0` with no game
references, and its own `Directory.Build.props` shadows the repository root's,
so the plugin's build-time game path detection does not apply to the test
build.

```bash
cd tests/path-translation && dotnet run -c Release
```

Exit code 0 means every check passed. Covered:

| Case | What it pins down |
| --- | --- |
| `under home` | An install inside `$HOME` beats the shorter home mapping; siblings still map to home |
| `outside` | An install outside `$HOME`; the exact prefix and a longer sibling folder name |
| `server` | An install root not named `SpaceEngineers` is used as given |
| `trailing slash` | A root path with a trailing separator |
| `no root` | `RootPath` unset: no install mapping, passthrough in both directions, nothing thrown |
| `other` | User data, temp, home and passthrough mappings are untouched |
| `unset home` | `$HOME` unset resolves to the real profile, not an assumed `/home/<user>` |

Translation is asymmetric, so most cases assert both directions.

"""Parse a LinuxCompatDiagnostics suite log and report pass/fail.

Usage:
  parse_results.py <LinuxCompatDiagnostics.log> [--security-manifest FILE]
  parse_results.py <LinuxCompatDiagnostics.log> --update-security-manifest FILE

Exit codes:
  0 - complete run, no FAIL lines, security manifest satisfied
  1 - complete run with FAIL lines, or a missing security probe
  2 - incomplete or missing log (no END terminator)

Failures are reported in three sections:
  security - path-containment probes (named "security: ..."); a FAIL here is a
             boundary escape or an over-tightened check, and is reported first
             regardless of owner tag
  [LINUX]  - linux-compat bugs (Windows-semantics expectations broken)
  [DOTNET] - follow-up items for the dotnet-compat repo (raw .NET 10
             expectations broken; may indicate an active dotnet-compat shim)

The security manifest is the regression net for the containment checks: it
lists every security probe name a green run is expected to report. A probe that
disappears - because the probe was deleted, renamed, or never ran since the
suite died early in that section - fails the run even though no FAIL line
exists for it. Regenerate it from a known-good run with
--update-security-manifest and commit the result.

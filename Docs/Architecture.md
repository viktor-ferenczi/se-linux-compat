# Architecture

How the plugin makes a Windows-only game run natively on Linux. Aimed at people
changing it; [Development.md](Development.md) covers building and debugging it.

## Projects

| Project | Assembly | Loader | Build defines |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ClientPlugin/` | `LinuxCompat` | Pulsar | `PULSAR` |
| `ServerPlugin/` | `LinuxCompatServer` | Magnetar | `MAGNETAR` |
| `Shared/` | compiled into both | (none) | (none) |

`Shared/` is a shared project (`Shared.shproj`), so every file in it compiles
into both assemblies; a change there has to build on both sides. Everything in
`Shared/` keeps the `ClientPlugin.*` namespace, including the parts the server
uses.

`LOCAL_BUILD` is defined by both csproj files and by neither loader, which is
how the plugin version is kept in step between the two build paths. See
[Versioning](Development.md#versioning).

## Startup sequence

The loader compiles the plugin from source and drives it through four entry
points, in this order:

1. `Preloader.Initialize()` runs `DependencyCheck.Run()`, which probes every
   native library the plugin needs and throws a `DllNotFoundException` naming
   the missing ones and their distribution packages. Without it a bare
   `DllNotFoundException` would surface much later from some P/Invoke.
   `NativeLibraries.Initialize()` then installs the DLL import resolver.
2. `Preloader.Patch(asmDef)` applies the Cecil prepatches to the assemblies
   listed in `Preloader.TargetDLLs` before they load. This is for what Harmony
   cannot reach: the Windows platform layer, the audio backend, the Steam
   layer, SharpDX, and the `MyFileSystem.Open` prologue.
3. `Preloader.Finish()` applies the Harmony `"Finish"` category, which is the
   bulk of the plugin (~125 patch classes; how many apply depends on the build,
   since much of `ClientPlugin/` is compiled out of the server). On the server
   this is also where `PathTranslation.Init()` and `ShimRegistration.Register()`
   run, because the server's `Plugin.Init` runs after the auto-loaded world's
   mods have already compiled.
4. `Plugin.Init` on the client runs `PathTranslation.Init()` first, since the
   Cecil-injected mod path getters need translation before any mod runs, then
   `ShimRegistration.Register()`, since mod compilation needs the rewriter
   shims whitelisted and referenced, and finally the Harmony `"Init"` category.

`Plugin.Update` runs every frame. It pumps `MainThreadDispatcher` so
render-thread continuations execute on the game thread, and it re-asserts the
Havok scheduling override, because a multiplayer event can rewrite `MyFakes`.

The plugin never modifies a game file. Every change is made to the loaded
image.

## Native libraries

`NativeLibraries` hooks `AssemblyLoadContext.Default.ResolvingUnmanagedDll` to map the
Windows library names the engine asks for onto their Linux counterparts:

| Engine asks for | Resolves to |
| --- | --- |
| `d3d11.dll`, `dxgi.dll` | DXVK (`libdxvk_d3d11.so`, `libdxvk_dxgi.so`) |
| `OpenAL32.dll`, `soft_oal.dll` | `libopenal.so` |
| `steam_api64.dll` | `libsteam_api.so` |
| `EOSSDK-Shipping.dll` | `libEOSSDK-Linux-Shipping.so` |
| `Havok.dll`, `RecastDetour.dll`, `VRage.Native.dll` | the PE-loader wrappers |

DirectX 11 therefore runs on DXVK over Vulkan, and the OpenAL, Steamworks and
Epic SDKs come from their native Linux builds.

The game's own three native libraries have no Linux build at all. The original
Windows binaries keep running behind the shim libraries from
[linux-native-wrappers](https://github.com/CometWorks/linux-native-wrappers),
which load the PE image and convert between the Windows and Linux ABIs at every
call. `HavokLinux`, `RecastDetourLinux` and `VRageNativeLinux` in
`Shared/Compatibility/` bind the managed side to those shims.

DXVK reads its configuration with `getenv`, which on Unix does not see
`Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable`, so `NativeLibraries` sets those variables
through `libc`'s `setenv` instead, without overwriting anything the user
exported.

## Windowing, input, audio and video

`SdlGameWindow` replaces the Win32 window with SDL3, and with it the cursor,
clipboard (`SdlClipboard`), joystick (`SdlJoystick`), icon (`SdlIconHelper`)
and splash screen (`MySdlSplashScreen`). `SdlRenderThread` keeps the render
loop on the thread SDL expects.

Steam's overlay has no native Wayland input hooks, so `SteamOverlayInput`
feeds Wayland input to Steam's existing Xlib hooks through a hidden 1×1
XWayland proxy window. The game window and Vulkan surface stay on Wayland. On
X11 no bridge is created, since those games already pass through the hooks. See
[tests/steam-overlay/README.md](../tests/steam-overlay/README.md).

Audio goes through OpenAL Soft (`SdlAudio`, `MySdlAudioInterop`, and
`XAudio2Shim` for the XAudio2 surface the engine expects). Video playback runs
through FFmpeg (`FfmpegBindings`, `MyLinuxVideoPlayer`) instead of DirectShow.

Shader compilation uses `D3DCompilerLinux`. The `SE_SHADER_OVERRIDE`
[diagnostic variable](Development.md#diagnostic-environment-variables) lets a
local directory shadow the game's shader sources.

## Paths and mod semantics

This is the easiest part of the plugin to get wrong, so the rule has no
exceptions:

> Mods see Windows-shaped paths. Game internals see native Linux paths. **All**
> translation happens at the mod API boundary. Never patch an internal game
> method just to make it tolerate a mod-shaped path.

Linux filesystems are case-sensitive and use a different separator, and mods
compiled for Windows assume neither. Three mechanisms carry that difference.

### 1. The compilation rewriter, `Shared/Rewriter/`

`CompilationRewriter` runs over every mod compilation (`MyApiTarget.Mod` only)
and `WindowsSemanticsRewriter` rewrites the syntax trees:

- `System.IO.Path` → `WindowsPath` (backslashes, a synthetic `C:\` drive)
- `TextWriter.WriteLine` → `WindowsTextWriter.WriteLine` (CRLF)
- `Stopwatch` → `WindowsStopwatch` (the 10 MHz Windows frequency)

Matching is symbol-based, so a mod's own type named `Path` is left alone, and
only `Path` members the shim actually implements are rewritten. An unknown
member keeps its original binding instead of becoming a compile error.

Mod API members that return filesystem paths (`IMyGamePaths.ContentPath`,
`IMySession.CurrentPath`, `IMyModContext.ModPath`, and so on) are wrapped at
the mod's call site in `WindowsPath.FromGame`, and values flowing the other way
in `ToGame`. Translation therefore lives in the mod's own compiled code:
plugins and engine code calling the same members keep receiving native paths.

`ShimRegistration` plumbs the shim types into the script compiler before any
mod compiles. It uses the raw in-memory metadata image rather than
`Assembly.Location`, because the loader renames the plugin assembly and only
the in-memory image carries the identity the whitelist was populated from. It
cannot be a Harmony patch on the whitelist: the game runs the whitelist batch
from `MySandboxGame.LoadData`, before `IPlugin.Init` is called.

### 2. Mod API wrappers, `Shared/Patches/PathHandling/ModApiWrappers/`

`WrappedUtilities` wraps `MyAPIGateway.Utilities` after
`MyModAPIHelper.Initialize` and keeps the Windows behaviour the rewriter cannot
express: storage filename validation, CRLF XML, and case handling.
`StorageSharing` emulates the Windows file-sharing semantics of the storage
API. Linux has no mandatory sharing, so a read that Windows would refuse while
a writer handle is open otherwise succeeds and yields a half-written (commonly
empty) file. Path *mapping* does not happen here; that belongs to the rewriter.

### 3. The ingress funnel, `PathCache.ResolveAbsolute`

Paths still arrive from mods through shared mutable data: definitions, saved
object builders, or a mod writing a path into a field the engine later reads.
`PathCache.ResolveAbsolute` in `Shared/Patches/PathHandling/PathHelpers.cs` is
the single entry point that turns such a path, whether Windows-shaped,
wrong-cased or both, into the real path on disk. It is backed by a flat cache
of the immutable `Content` and `Bin64` trees plus mtime-validated per-directory
caches for mutable roots, so resolution does not walk the filesystem per call.

`MyFileSystemOpenPrepatch` injects a call to it as the prologue of
`MyFileSystem.Open`, which is why `VRage.Library.dll` is in `TargetDLLs`.

`IngressTrace` records every internal site that still receives a
drive-prefixed mod path, together with the stack that delivered it. Debug
builds always flag conversions made outside the sanctioned funnel; release
builds need
[`SE_LINUX_COMPAT_TRACE_INGRESS=1`](Development.md#diagnostic-environment-variables).
A new report there means a missing wrapper, not a reason to add another
translation site.

### Root mapping, `PathTranslation`

`PathTranslation.Init()` builds the longest-prefix mapping between the native
roots and the Proton-shaped paths mods expect: the install root, user data,
temp and home. The install root comes from `MyFileSystem.RootPath`, which the
launcher sets before any plugin runs, so the plugin knows nothing about Steam
or where the game was installed. Matching accepts paths with or without the
synthetic drive prefix, and the mapping is asymmetric, so both directions are
tested in [tests/path-translation](../tests/path-translation/README.md).
